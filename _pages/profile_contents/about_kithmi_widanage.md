<strong>BIO:</strong> Kithmi N.D. Widanage is a Ph.D. research scholar at the School of Engineering and Informatics of the University of Sussex. She started her Ph.D. in January 2022 and is working on the development of robotic manipulators to be operated in an unknown environment. She received her B.Sc. Engineering (Hons) degree in 2018 from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, specializing in Mechanical Engineering. Since then, she has been employed in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa, first as an instructor and then as a lecturer until June 2021. She joined a research group funded by the NIHR PrOTeCT Grant as a research scholar in June 2021 and worked on developing circular external fixators.  

<strong>Research interests:</strong> Her current research includes the structure and controller design of a robotic manipulator for nuclear decommissioning. She is also working on developing a controller for contact-based operations on unknown surfaces. Part of this work was presented at IROS 2023.
